## Backstory

Rook Ironhand, half-giant born to hardship, is a survivor of the slums of Morros. His mother vanished during the Skyfall disappearances, fueling his determination to fix, defend, and invent for the powerless. Rook has become the gentle giant of his district—relentless, loyal, always ready with a solution or a shield. His journey is a blend of urban mystery, found family, and magical invention.
